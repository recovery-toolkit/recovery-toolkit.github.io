# Evening Review

## When we retire
When we retire at night, we constructively review our day.

Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest or fearful?  
Do we owe an apology?  
Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with someone immediately?  
Were we kind and loving toward all?  
What could we have done better?  
Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time?  
Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the stream of life?

But we must be careful not to drift into worry, remorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others. After making our review we ask for forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures should be taken.

## Evening meditation
Pray or meditate for a set period of time, perhaps after reflecting on your step 6 & 7 or your Steel on Steel notes.

## 9th step prayer
Give me the strength and direction to do the right thing no matter what the consequences may be.  
Help me to consider others and not harm them in any way.  
Help me to consult with others before I take any actions that would cause me to be sorry.  
Help me to not repeat such behaviors.  
Show me the way of patience, tolerance, kindliness, and love and help me live the spiritual life.
