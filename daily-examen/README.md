# daily-examen

The Daily Examen [[1]](#footnotes) is a gift of brief reflective time that Ignatius of Loyola gave to himself and recommended to others. It is intended to help you recognise God [[2]](#footnotes) as you look back over the course of your day.

***It is important to note that the Daily Examen is simply a set of suggestions for you to adapt to your own character and life.***

Begin with a pause and a slow, deep breath or two; become aware that you are in the presence of the Holy.

## thanksgiving

What am I especially grateful for in the past day?

- The gift of another day?
- The love and support I have received?
- The courage I have mustered?
- An event that took place today?

## petition

I am about to review my day; I ask for the light to know God and to know myself as God sees me.

## review

Where have I felt true joy today?  
What has troubled me today?  
What has challenged me today?  
Where and when did I pause today?  
Have I noticed God's presence in any of this?  

## response

In the light of my review, what is my response to the God of my life?

## a look ahead

As I look ahead, what comes to mind?
With what spirit do I want to enter tomorrow?
