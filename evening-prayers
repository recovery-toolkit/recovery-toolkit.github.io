# Evening Prayers
## 9th step prayer
Give me the strength and direction to do the right thing no matter what the consequences may be.  
Help me to consider others and not harm them in any way.  
Help me to consult with others before I take any actions that would cause me to be sorry.  
Help me to not repeat such behaviors.  
Show me the way of patience, tolerance, kindliness, and love and help me live the spiritual life.
