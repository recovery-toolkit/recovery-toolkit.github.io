# On Awakening
## Set-aside prayer
Help me to set aside  
Everything I think I know  
About myself  
My disease  
The twelve steps  
And especially you  
That I may have an open mind  
And a new experience of all these things  
Please let me see the truth
## On Awakening, Part 1
On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.

### Third Step Prayer
I offer myself to thee -- to build with me and do with me as thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of thy power, thy love, and thy way of life. May I do thy will always!

## Daily Planning
### On Awakening, Part 2
In thinking about our day, we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while.
### Plan your day
### Watch, Ask and Turn
Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment and fear, when these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them. We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly, if we have harmed anyone. Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help. Love and tolerance of others is our code.
### Seventh Step Prayer
I am now ready that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.
