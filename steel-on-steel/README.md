# Steel on Steel

## What is "Steel on Steel"
Steel on Steel (SOS) is a spiritual exercise for members of twelve-step fellowships interested in attaining the fourth dimension of existence.

Participation in an SOS group, represents a commitment to helping each other to maintain fit spiritual condition. This process fosters a special bond among members as they grow in their own conscious contact with the higher power of their own understanding.

Steel on Steel is all about fearless and thorough action in a spirit of love and tolerance and is not for people interested in half measures or middle-of-the-road solutions. Do not start this process unless you are committed to improving conscious contact and applying the principles represented by the steps in all your affairs.

In this process, we offer each other spiritual licence to offer comments and considerations upon any area of our lives. Nothing is off-limits to the love and guidance found in the group. Through prayer, meditation, and sharing with each other, we seek the truth about your current spiritual condition.

The group provides a mirror through which we can see our Selves.

## How the meeting works

An SOS group:
- Comprises 2-4 people
- Meets once a month

The chair opens the meeting starts 10 (ten) minutes of silence followed by the Set-Aside prayer.  

There follows a reading from the Big Book from pages 62-63 to remind us:
- What the problem is
- What the solution is
- What we decided to do about it

This is followed by the Third Step prayer is read to reaffirm the decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of the higher power of our own understanding.

Each individual has 10 minutes to share about their current condition. The time limit keeps us brief and to the point, avoiding self-justification. We leave no stone unturned. We suggest that the list of questions be used to guide sharing.

After the member has shared, the group goes around the room, sharing back considerations. This repeats until all members of the group have shared.

We have provided our own meeting format [here](sos-format.pdf). Feel free to adapt is, as we have or use it as is.
